      <h3>What is a Dat archive?</h3>
      <p>
        A Dat archive is a collection of files that can be efficiently shared
        with others on a peer-to-peer network.
      </p>

      <h3 id="create-dat-archive">How do I create a Dat archive?</h3>
      <p>
        You can use the <a href="https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker">
        Beaker browser</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/datproject/dat">
        official Dat command line tool</a>, or the <a href="https://github.com/datproject/dat-desktop">
        official Dat desktop app</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="archive-privacy">Who can see the archives that I upload to Hashbase?</h3>
      <h4>Free plan</h4>
      <p>
        If you use Hashbase's free plan, the Dat URL for <em>all</em> of your
        archives will be listed on your public profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of the nature of the Dat peer-to-peer protocol, anyone with
        the URL for an archive will be able to view and download the archive's
        files. <a href="/account/upgrade">Upgrade to pro</a>
      </p>

      <h4>Hashbase Pro</h4>
      <p>
        Archives uploaded with Hashbase Pro are unlisted by default. That means
        they won't be listed on your public Hashbase profile, and only people
        who know the Dat URL for your archive will be able to see its files.
        <a href="/account/upgrade">Upgrade to pro</a>
      </p>

      <h3 id="self-hosting">
        Can I self host Hashbase?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Yes. The software that powers Hashbase, <a href="https://github.com/datprotocol/hypercloud">
        Hypercloud</a>, is open source and easy to deploy.
