      <h2>4. Web site navigational information</h2>
      <h3>Cookies, Web beacons, and IP addresses</h3>
      <p>
        Hashbase uses commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate the Company’s Web sites (“Web Site Navigational Information”). This section describes the types of Web Site Navigational Information that may be collected on the Company’s Web sites and how this information may be used.
      </p>

      <h4>Cookies</h4>
      <p>
        Hashbase uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit the Company’s Web site, Hashbase’s servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Hashbase, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Contact Me” or a “30 Day Free Trial” Web form), you remain anonymous to the Company.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hashbase uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. Please note that if you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company’s Web sites, but the functionality and features of the Services may be affected, and you may not be able to successfully use the Services. Similarly, if you disable JavaScript, some features of the Company’s Web sites may not function properly, and some areas of the Company’s Web sites may not function at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have chosen to identify yourself to Hashbase, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into the Services, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed your browser. These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the Services and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use the Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hashbase uses persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Company’s Web site. When you purchase the Services or provide the Company with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company places on your Web browser. The Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company’s Web site, but you will not be able to successfully use the Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hashbase may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with Data About Hashbase Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Services.
      </p>

      <h4>Web beacons</h4>
      <p>
        Hashbase uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web sites and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. For example, Hashbase may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to the Company’s Web site. Hashbase uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s Web sites and email communications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hashbase may use information from Web beacons in combination with Data About Hashbase Customers to provide you with information about the Company and the Services.
      </p>

      <h4>IP addresses</h4>
      <p>
        When you visit Hashbase’s Web site, the Company collects your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, Hashbase uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Company’s Web site.
      </p>

      <h4>Do Not Track</h4>
      <p>
        Currently, various browsers – including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari – offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Hashbase does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Hashbase takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Public forums and customer testimonials</h2>
      <p>
        Hashbase may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the Company’s Web site. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. Hashbase is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hashbase may post a list of Customers and testimonials on the Company’s Web sites that contain information such as Customer names and titles. Hashbase obtains the consent of each Customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.

      <h2>11. Customer data</h2>
      <p>
        As part of using our Services, Customers may submit electronic data or information to the Services (“Customer Data”) which may include personal information. The Company generally has no direct relationship with the individuals to whom Customer Data may pertain, which we process on the behalf of our Customers. Any uses of Customer Data by the Company are done so pursuant to the Company’s Terms of Service or a subscription agreement in place between the Company and the relevant Customer (or his/her organization), which exclusively govern the Company’s treatment of Customer Data and supersede this Privacy Statement in case of conflict, or as required by law. If personal information pertaining to you as an individual has been submitted to us by a Customer as Customer Data and you wish to exercise any rights you may have to access, correct, amend, or delete such data, please inquire with the Customer (or his/her organization) directly. If an authorized Customer requests that we update or remove the data in question and the Customer has no ability to do so via use of the Services, we will acknowledge their request within 30 days.
