      <p>
        Blue Link Labs uses cookies to make interactions with the Company’s Web sites easy and meaningful. When you visit the Company’s Web site, Blue Link Labs's servers send a cookie to your computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify you; they merely recognize your Web browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Blue Link Labs, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form (such as a “Contact Me” or a “30 Day Free Trial” Web form), you remain anonymous to the Company.
      </p>

      <p>
        Blue Link Labs uses cookies that are session-based and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your browser or turn off your computer. Please note that if you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company’s Web sites, but the functionality and features of Hashbase Services may be affected, and you may not be able to successfully use Hashbase Services. Similarly, if you disable JavaScript, some features of the Company’s Web sites may not function properly, and some areas of the Company’s Web sites may not function at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have chosen to identify yourself to Blue Link Labs, the Company uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the Company to uniquely identify you. Each time you log into Hashbase Services, a session cookie containing an encrypted, unique identifier that is tied to your account is placed your browser. These session cookies allow the Company to uniquely identify you when you are logged into Hashbase Services and to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies are required to use Hashbase Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        Blue Link Labs uses persistent cookies that only the Company can read and use to identify browsers that have previously visited the Company’s Web site. When you purchase Hashbase Services or provide the Company with personal information, a unique identifier is assigned you. This unique identifier is associated with a persistent cookie that the Company places on your Web browser. The Company is especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, the Company does not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. If you disable your Web browser’s ability to accept cookies, you will be able to navigate the Company’s Web site, but you will not be able to successfully use Hashbase Services.
      </p>

      <p>
        Blue Link Labs may use information from session and persistent cookies in combination with Data About Blue Link Labs Customers to provide you with information about the Company and Hashbase Services.
      </p>

      <h4>Web beacons</h4>
      <p>
        Blue Link Labs uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Customers and Visitors’ usage of the Company’s Web sites and interaction with emails from the Company. Web beacons are clear electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on your computer, such as cookies, when you viewed a particular Web site tied to the Web beacon, and a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon. For example, Blue Link Labs may place Web beacons in marketing emails that notify the Company when you click on a link in the email that directs you to the Company’s Web site. Blue Link Labs uses Web beacons to operate and improve the Company’s Web sites and email communications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Blue Link Labs may use information from Web beacons in combination with Data About Blue Link Labs Customers to provide you with information about the Company and Hashbase Services.
      </p>

      <h4>IP addresses</h4>
      <p>
        When you visit Blue Link Labs' Web site, the Company collects your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, Blue Link Labs uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Company’s Web site.
      </p>

      <h4>Do Not Track</h4>
      <p>
        Currently, various browsers – including Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari – offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to Web sites visited by the user about the user's browser DNT preference setting. Blue Link Labs does not currently commit to responding to browsers' DNT signals with respect to the Company's Web sites, in part, because no common industry standard for DNT has been adopted by industry groups, technology companies or regulators, including no consistent standard of interpreting user intent. Blue Link Labs takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will make efforts to continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Public forums and customer testimonials</h2>
      <p>
        Blue Link Labs may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the Company’s Web site. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages. Blue Link Labs is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.
      </p>

      <p>
        Blue Link Labs may post a list of Customers and testimonials on the Company’s Web sites that contain information such as Customer names and titles. Blue Link Labs obtains the consent of each Customer prior to posting any information on such a list or posting testimonials.
