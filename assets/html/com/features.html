<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Reliable rehosting</h3>
<p>
Hashbase acts as a "super peer" and rehosts your Dat archives, so your files
are always available, even when you're offline.
</p>

<h3>Archive history backup</h3>
<p>
Dat maintains a log of all the changes you make to your archive's
files. In addition to storing your archive's files, we store a backup
of the entire history log.
</p>

<h3>HTTPS Mirroring <span class="pro-tag">Pro</span></h3>
<p>
In addition to rehosting your files on the Dat peer-to-peer network, we
mirror the content on the Web so you can share it with anyone.
</p>

<h3>DNS Shortnames <span class="pro-tag">Pro</span></h3>
<p>
Pick a custom shortname for each of your archives. For example,
catsrcute.alice.hashbase.io.
